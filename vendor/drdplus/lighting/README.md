#### Warning - it distinct from PPH a bit

Because we strongly disagree to get different results for same numbers just because simplified or extended rules are used,
so this is why this library **rounds contrast** always by standard way, from half to up.

For details check our [resolution on PPH v1.1](https://github.com/jaroslavtyc/drd-plus-pph-v1-1/blob/master/opravy/p%C5%99%C3%ADklad_s_prudk%C3%BDm_sv%C4%9Btlem_podle_roz%C5%A1i%C5%99uj%C3%ADc%C3%ADch_pravidel_m%C3%A1_chybu.md#odlišnosti-mezi-zjednodušenými-a-rozšiřujícími-pravidly-pro-vidění)
